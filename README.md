About Project
Supermarket billing system is a simple mini project in C++, built as a console application without using graphics. Itâ€™s just a demonstration of the use of file handling and stream class in C++ language. Supermarket billing system is based on the concept to generate the bill reports and to add items and update their details. It is accurate in calculation and printing; they also generate records.
Existing System and the Proposed System
In the existing system, the customer does not know what and where are the items located. He/she has to look for the particular item throughout the shopping mall. To overcome this problem, a solution is developed. The customer can easily search for the items using his phone and by item ID, he/she can easily buy those items. Even the payment can be done through mobile. This removes burden on the customer as well as on the workers in the supermarket.
